<!-- ****************************************BIO Section -->

	<div class="bio">
	<p>A Chicago native, or more accurately from the home of Ovaltine USA and Portillo's Restaurants: Villa Park, Ill. Farther, my family were Slovakian immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island determined to succeed in this new land of opportunity.</p>

	<p>In my first job as a professional designer for a large pharmaceutical company, I learned that design is the cornerstone of good communication. Although my responsibilities were limited to in-house graphic design and creating direct mail materials, this experience was great training and an important step towards design, budgeting and management.</p>

	<p>In my next position, I learned the fundamentals of press production and different types of forward printing. This is an industry that’s reinvented itself in astonishing leaps and bounds, becoming “greener” and more cost-effective within a few short years.</p>

	<p>Moving to the financial sector, first within an accounting firm and on to work for a national financial institution, I managed creative projects and programs in a variety of media. My deviation towards UI/UX design and automation within a digital, reporting and financial function has become my focus. Striving to frame financial data within an orderly, simple and effective mannor to drive stronger decistion making. As industries develop and grow in new directions, I’ll continue learning new ways to design my view of the world and myself.</p>
